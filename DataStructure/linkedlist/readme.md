LinkedList

An empty linkedlist should be instantiated which includes a head property.
we use insert,include and print.insert takes a value and add it to the node and the value will be the head.
include returns a boolean if the value is within the list.And
print on the other side takes no argument and output all Node values in the Linked List.

Big o for space is 0(1) and time is 0(n);
