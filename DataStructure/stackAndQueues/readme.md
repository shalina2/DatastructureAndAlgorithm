A stack is conatiner of objects that are inserted and removed according to the LIFO princple.Push adds an item to
the top of the stack while pop removes it from the top.
We can use an array or linkedList as the Storage structure to implement the stack or queue pattern.
This assignments includes starting from creating Node and pointer to the Next node as well as creating
Stack with a top property.I created a method with all Top,Push and Peek.

Queue is a useful data structure.putting an item in queue is called dequeue.
I also included methods for the front,enqueue,dequeue,and peek as well.

Approach and efficency
Big o for stack: space o(1)
                 Time o(1)
